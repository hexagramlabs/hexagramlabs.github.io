Once upon a time, I worked as a musician. But lately I’ve been building and taking other things apart. I’m reorganizing my notes and configuring this new site. Previously, I’ve written elsewhere on the internet: GitHub, Blogspot, Tumblr, and Substack. 

I'm interested in quantitative things like physics, math, and engineering. But I am also fascinated by the less tangible aspects of nature--our lived experience, meaning-making processes, and social rituals. So, I find myself thinking about brains, language, and economics a lot, too.
